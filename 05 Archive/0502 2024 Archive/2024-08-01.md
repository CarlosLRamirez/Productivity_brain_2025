## 📓 Apuntes
- Ports used by MIMIX:
	- MIMIX Installation 50410 , 50411, 50412, 50413, 50414, 50415por
	- Availability Manager 8410, 8411, 8412
	- Vision Solutions Portal (VSP)  8410, 8411, 8412

Additionally, there are several other ports are assigned/used by the IBM Toolbox for Java. They are:

446 drda  
8470 as-central  
8471 as-database  
8472 as-dtaq  
8473 as-file  
8475 as-rmtcmd  
8476 as-signon

```
In addition to the MIMIX port in the TFRDFN (50410 by default), CMPFILDTA command (or #FILDTA audit) could  potentially try to use 50411 and above. It tries TFRDFN + 1. If that is busy, it keeps adding 1 and trying until it finds a free one 

For firewalls, the user must open as many ports above the TFRDFN as they think they will ever have simultaneous CMPFILDTA jobs (or #FILDTA audits) running. The total number of ports used by the remote application is 1 (Once a free port above 50410 is found, that same port will be used for all the threads used by that articular CMPFILDTA job). 

The remote instance will still use random ports in making the connections for the multiple threads, but this has no impact on functioning with a firewall. CMPFILDTA can use up to 100 thread groups, if `the user requests.
